### How to play 
While the game is not fully released for school usage, classes signed up might not have any added question to their database. If you plan to play, we encourage to create a school for you and your friends and add your questions manually by signing up as a teacher. 

If you wish to play the game right away, we encourage you sign up as a student with ICL at modules such as Mathematics, French and Science which have already a great number of questions! 

1. You can make your account at our [WebApp](http://flappyfish.eu-gb.cf.appdomain.cloud/)

2. After creating your account, you can download the game [here](https://github.com/ej3517/DeeperThanBlue/releases/)

3. Login and wait for your data to load into your device! 

4. Choose the class you want to play and Good Luck! 

### Important notice
None of the current releases has a safe password storage method and we discourage any user of registering with a common or sensitive password!
